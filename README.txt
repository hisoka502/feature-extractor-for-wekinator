【Introduction】
This featurer extractor is written in Processing. It grabs the diameter of the circle on the canvas and send that float value to Wekinator. You can use 'a' and 's' keys to make the circle bigger or smaller, which let you create all sorts of different training examples.

In Wekinator, you can use classification or regression models since you can control the circle diameter in a linear way.

Just a heads up, you'll need to have Processing installed on your computer to compile and run the code.
